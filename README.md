# Active Scene Understanding From Image Sequences for Next-Generation Computer Vision 
Bachelor thesis by Ralph Meier & Dano Roost.
Check out the following branches:

- baseline-version: CNN only scene understanding
- cnn-plus-rnn-version: CNN + RNN (best performing) uses LSTM to aggregate information over multiple timesteps
- convlstm-version-new: ConvLSTM version that also aggregates data over timesteps
